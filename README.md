# 🔍 Medical Pills Detection using Ultralytics YOLO11  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/muhammadrizwan11/Medical-Pills-detection-using-Ultralytics-YOLO11-)

## 📘 Overview  
This project demonstrates the use of **YOLOv11** by Ultralytics for detecting medical pills using a custom object detection dataset. It serves as a starting point to explore the latest advancements in real-time object detection.

## 🧪 Dataset  
The dataset contains images of pills annotated for object detection.  
- **Training Set**: 92 images  
- **Validation Set**: 23 images  
- **Class**: `pill`

## 🚀 Applications  
- **Pharmaceutical Sorting**: Automate pill classification by color, shape, and size.  
- **AI Research**: Benchmark model performance on healthcare-related object detection.  
- **Digital Inventory Systems**: Use computer vision for real-time pill recognition and tracking.

## 🛠️ Requirements  
- Python 3.8+  
- Ultralytics YOLOv11 (latest)  
- Other dependencies listed in the notebook or install via pip:
```bash
pip install ultralytics
```
